<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![EnderIO Logo](img/logo.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-io)

[![Build Status](https://ci.tterrag.com/job/EnderIO-Modules/job/EnderIO-Hourly/badge/icon)](https://ci.tterrag.com/job/EnderIO-Modules/job/EnderIO-Hourly/)

Ender IO is a full-featured tech mod. It has armor, tools, weapons, machines, conduits, inventory management, mobs, etc.

Ender IO has been rewritten from the ground-up to support the latest version of Minecraft.
Some features may be missing or work differently, however we are working to re-implement everything we know and love about the original.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### For Players

Download the latest JAR file from GitHub releases or from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-io) and drop it into your `mods` folder.

### For Mod Developers

EnderIO is available via our maven.
Update your `build.gradle` to contain the following:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://maven.rover656.dev/releases' }
}

dependencies {
    // Include Ender IO API for compilation
    compileOnly fg.deobf("com.enderio:enderio-<module>:<VERSION>:api")
    
    // Use EnderIO at runtime
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf("com.enderio:enderio-<module>:<VERSION>")
}
```
If you need any feature in the api, contact us.

> **Note**
> If you are checking that EnderIO exists, currently it works to check for the mod id `enderio` however, it is possible that we will release Ender IO modularly again in the future.
> To support this, check for EnderIO using the module mod id's instead, `enderio_<module>`.
